Lab 5a Guessing Game Enhancement 3 Example Output (note, once you add the y/n ability, you only need to provide one set of output because you’ll show that you’ve played at least twice)Welcome to the guessing game! I'll choose a random number between 1 and a limit of your choice, and you guess what it is.       How high would you like the guessing range to be? 100                                                                           I'm thinking of a number!
